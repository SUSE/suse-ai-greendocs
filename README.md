# SUSE AI Greendocs
This repository hosts SUSE AI Greendocs â€“ your go-to resource for practical, actionable technical reference documents (we call them greendocs) for implementing AI solutions with SUSE technologies.

## What is a Greendoc?
A greendoc is a detailed, prescriptive guide that outlines a specific AI use case or solution. Think of it as a blueprint: it provides the steps, configurations, and considerations necessary to deploy and manage AI workloads effectively on SUSE platforms. Our greendocs aim to demystify complex AI implementations by breaking them down into manageable, repeatable processes.

## What You'll Find Here
Greendocs for various AI use cases: Each greendoc focuses on a distinct scenario, offering practical guidance for setting up and utilizing AI technologies with SUSE products.

__Practical Examples__: Alongside the greendocs, you'll find ready-to-use code snippets, configurations, and scripts that you can adapt and implement in your own environments. These examples are designed to accelerate your AI journey.

## How to Use This Repository
__Explore the Greendocs__: Browse the greendocs/ directory to discover detailed guides on various AI topics.

__Leverage Practical Examples__: Check the examples/ directory for executable code and configurations that complement the greendocs.

__Implement and Innovate__: Use the greendocs and examples as a starting point for building and optimizing your own AI solutions on SUSE infrastructure.
